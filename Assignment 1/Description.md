# Threat Modelling Assignment

The purpose of this assignment was to put threat modelling techniques to use in order to assess a system's security. The system was a typical soft drink vending machine. We had to consider the following:
- The assets of the system, including coins and drinks
- Possible harms that could befall the system, like someone taking a sledge hammer to it
- The security goals for the system
- The possible threats to the system
- Any mitigations that could be used to reduce the threats identified.
