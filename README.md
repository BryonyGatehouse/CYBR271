# Secure Programming

This course addresses the concepts, techniques and tools required for developing software that reliably preserves the security properties of the information and systems they protect. The course covers common software vulnerabilities, specifying security requirements, secure design principles and techniques for evaluating software security. Practical work will involve developing and evaluating the security of C and Java programs. NB: this course will first run in 2019.

### Course Learning Objectives

Students who pass this course will be able to:
1. Describe the role of, and develop security requirements and abuse scenarios based upon, an understanding of the differences between the methodologies used by attacker and a testers to discover security vulnerabilities that could lead to security risks.
2. Apply knowledge of threats, vulnerabilities and how these may interact to choosing and implementing client-side and server-side software security controls to mitigate software security risks.
3. Evaluate the security of software using a range of security techniques including vulnerability assessment, fuzzing and code review.
